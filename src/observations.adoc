== Observations

Observations are run only in the context of a pull request, and reports only "success" or "neutral" run status, so it will not block merges in case link:https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging[required checks] are setup for branch protection.

If there are zero observations the step reports success, if some are found it reports the neutral status. A neutral status is shown in the pull request, which help s the reviewer to identify and check the observations.

=== New void type used

If abaplint is configured with `errorNamespace` some types are trusted by abaplint to be correct in all uses, these types are called void types.

This observation reports findings if new void types are introduced by the pull request, this helps identifying if the footprint towards eg. dependencies or the standard system increases.
