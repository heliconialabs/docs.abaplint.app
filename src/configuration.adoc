== Configuration

=== Repository Access

The administrator of a GitHub organization controls which repositories that abaplint.app can access via https://github.com/apps/abaplint/installations/new.

Only grant access to repositories where abaplint.app will be used,

Administrators can revoke or grant additional repository access at any time, note that the app permissions are limited to read and updating information in pull requests.

=== Rule Configuration

abaplint is configured via `/abaplint.json` in the git repository, if no configuration file is present, the default configuration is used, which have all rules enabled.

The default configuration can be found on link:https://playground.abaplint.org[playground.abaplint.app], or by running `abaplint -d`on command line.

If editing the configuration file via link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=larshp.vscode-abaplint[vscode abaplint extension], the editor will know the format of the json configuration file and help discovering and updating rule configurations.

link:https://rules.abaplint.org[rules.abaplint.org] lists and documents all rules which can be configured.

=== App Configuration

A file with one of the following filenames can optionally be placed in the root of the git directory,

* `abaplint-app.json`
* `abaplint-app.jsonc`
* `abaplint-app.json5`

Only the first file found will be taken into account.

The file can be used to configure abaplint.app features. The corresponding schema can be accessed at https://schema.abaplint.app/schema.json.

==== Multiple Configurations

By adding a `abaplint-app.json` file it is possible to have abaplint.app run multiple abaplint configurations. link:#_observations[Observations] and link:#_suggestions[suggestions] are reported only for the first configuration. Configurations are processed in the sequence as defined in the file,

[source,json]
----
{
  "configurations": {
    "default": {
      "filename": "./abaplint.jsonc"
    },
    "v740sp05": {
      "filename": "./abaplintonprem.jsonc"
    }
  }
}
----

When running with the above configuration, abaplint.app also analyzes the source code using `abaplintonprem.jsonc` and issues the result as "abaplint / v740sp05",

==== Experimental Features

Experimental features are disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting

[source,json]
----
{
  "experimentalFeatures": true
}
----

These features change over time and are only documented when the feature becomes generally available.

=== Dependent GitHub Actions

abaplint.app helps with static analysis, the next step in a CI pipeline is typically to run the unit tests.
Github Actions can be used to trigger any logic after the static analysis completes.

Template and working example can be found at https://github.com/heliconialabs/abaplint-app-dependent-action

Example Github Action configuration,

[source,yml]
----
name: unit

on:
  pull_request

jobs:
  wait:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
     - name: Wait for other checks to succeed
       uses: lewagon/wait-on-check-action@v1.1.1
       with:
         ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
         check-name: abaplint
         repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
         wait-interval: 1
  unit:
    needs: wait
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Echo github context
      run: echo '${{ toJson(github.event) }}' || true
